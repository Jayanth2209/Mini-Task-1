# Task-1
# Project 1 - Easy Soil Moisture Sensor Arduino 7 Segment Display :
This is a fairly easy project to make. It's used to check the moisture content of the soil and display it on a 7-segment display using an Arduino Uno and a Soil Moisture sensor. Suitable wiring is done. To check the moisture content, the sensor is dipped into the soil and the display on the 7-segment display shows the moisture content in the soil.

# Project 2 - Arduino Barometer :

# Project 3 - Raspberry Pi based Weather Station:
This project is to build a compact weather station using a wireless Raspberry Pi Zero. They used AZ-Touch Pi0 kit for the display. It is made compatible with Pizero. Then the Raspbian image is copied into an SD card and is put into the Pizero. This Raspbian image is burned and a SSH connection is enabled and the details are entered. The Raspberry Pi is then rebooted. The weather station will be launched after rebooting.

# Project 4 - DIY GY-906 Infrared Thermometer using Arduino:
This project is to build a No-Contact Infrared Thermometer using an Arduino Nano and a GY-906 Temperature Sensor to measure the surface temperature of an object and display on an OLED display. All the components are assembled as per the circuit diagram. The MLX90614 sensor collects the data and the installed program continuously reads this data and displays the temperature on the OLED screen when the switch is touched. The casing for the thermometer components is obtained by 3D-Printing. These thermometers are now in great use, in the first line of detection of corona virus.

# Project 5 - DIY Hand Sanitizer Dispenser :
This project is to build a Touch free Soap/Sanitizer dispenser using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor. An IR Sensor could also be used but an ultrasonic sensor, though a bit expensive is more accurate. The servo motor and a copper wire are used to generate a downward force to push the sanitizer. The code is uploaded defining all the basic setups and then it is ready to use. All the components are packed properly. The sanitizer is pushed when a target is 10cm or closer to the sensor.
